# From Data to Decisions : Interactive-Sales-Performance-Power-BI-Dashboard

A sales performance dashboard is displayed in this Power BI visualization. With important metrics on geographic distribution, sales volume, and profitability over time, the dashboard offers a thorough overview of sales data broken down by product categories: technology, office supplies, and furniture.

Key Highlights:

1. Postal Code Mapping:
The heat map shows the distribution of customers by postal code across the United States. Of the 9,994 postal codes that are recorded, 455 out of 632 are actively displayed. Although the map's goal is to highlight regional sales density, it is currently not fully functional due to invalid Bing Maps credentials.


2. Quantity of Sales by Category:
According to a vertical bar chart, office supplies are the most sold item, outpacing both furniture and Technology by a significant margin. This suggests that office supplies are high-frequency, high-volume items in the product mix.

3. Profit Analysis by Category and Order Date: This line chart or time series illustrates how profitability has evolved from January 2014 through late 2017. Overall, we've seen consistent growth, with notable peaks in profit, particularly from mid-2016 onward. These patterns likely reflect successful sales initiatives or expanding market reach during that time.

  
#### Analytical Insights : Our dashboard features interactive filters by category, so you can easily explore specific segments in detail. By combining spatial and temporal data, we offer a comprehensive view of how business performance varies over time and across locations.This visualization really showcases advanced proficiency in Power BI, especially in combining geospatial analytics, time-series trend analysis, and category segmentation .
